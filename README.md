# image_classification_cnn
Chest x-ray image classification using convolutional neural networks 

The code3.py file contains the entire python code for the project. 
The code requires all the necessary packages, for instance tensorflow, keras, etc for its successful execution.

The main directory where the code3.py file is, should contain the unzipped 'Data' folder downloaded from kaggle having the entire dataset.
For more info on Data folder contact me through linkedin.
This 'Data' folder should have the train and test sub folders as well.

The code is divided into two parts within the same .py file, with part1 being pretrained model analysis and plotting, and the other part2 being 
proposed new model and its plot. 

*Code will take a lot of time in running and giving results due to heavier dataset usage.
